## New to Version 4?
Vorteks Version 4 (v4) is a complete rewrite of Vorteks, built on .NET 9 and WinUI 3. It brings a modern interface, improved performance, and new features to enhance the experience.
V3 consisted of multiple applications (Data Manager, Processing Environment, Visualization Environment), while V4 combines all these functionalities into a single, cohesive application.
V4 is designed to be more user-friendly and efficient, making it easier for users to manage, process, and visualize their data all in one place.
V4 is not backward compatible with V3, meaning that projects created in V3 cannot be opened in V4. Users will need to recreate their projects in the new version.

---

### V4 Differences from V3:
- **Single application** for all functionalities (data management, processing, visualization).
- **Application Search bar** for quick access to features and commands.
- **Cloud Integrations**
	- AWS
		- AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)
		- S3 Data Source

---

#### Data Management
- Manage datasets, document types, documents, term lists all in one place.
- **Term lists are shared across the entire project**, no need to import/export between different applications.
	- Term lists now have enhanced UI for easier creation and management.
	- No need to learn v3 text encodings to use regex terms, or replacement values, etc.
- **Modify document types before data is imported** (during processing), or modify them after data is imported (in the document type manager).
- **Easily disable document fields** that clutter your available fields without deleting them.
- **Dataset Dashboards**
	- Each dataset has a dashboard that provides insights into the data contained within it.
	- Create widgets to visualize key metrics and statistics about your dataset.
		- **Map Widget** to visualize geospatial data.
		- **Graphs and Charts** to represent data distributions and trends.
		- **Word Clouds** to highlight frequently occurring terms.
		- **Notes** to document important information about the dataset.
- **Document View supports color legends** to gain insights into a document at a glance.

#### Color Legends have been separated into specific types
- Document Type
- Value
- Term List
- Temporal
- Number

---

#### Search
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Compound search terms
- Separate search term types (String, Number, Temporal)

---

#### Processing
- Easier than ever to build and run processing pipelines.
- Double click processing modules to **quickly add them to the pipeline**.
- **Automatically connect modules** when added to the pipeline.
- **Module connections have smarter pathing** to avoid overlapping disparate connections.
- **Universal Converter is built in** to the data source reader module, no need to add it separately.
- Previewing documents as they move though a module is built in. **No need to add XML Checker anymore.** Just turn on "Preview" in the module.
- Write processed documents **directly to a dataset** in your project. No need to move between different applications.
- **Re-process datasets** to fix issues or apply new processing steps.

---

#### Processing Wizard
- **Build processors quickly** in a step-by-step manner. 
- Contains **tutorial information** when learning how processors work.

---

#### Visualizations
- Visualizations are built on the new **Vulcan rendering engine**, providing better performance and more features.
- Views are designed with more **level of detail improvements** for viewing large views when zoomed out.
- Views can be built UP (like Nexus view in V3) where **data is added to the view incrementally** (Explore Mode)
- Improved support for **shortcut keys**
	- Example: Ctrl + F to search in views
	- Esc to clear selections
	- Esc a 2nd time to zoom all the way out (HOME)
	- Hold Left Mouse and Right mouse buttons while moving the mouse up or down to quick scroll
	- See "Shortcut info" in the command bar for all available shortcuts
- Color Details
    - **Color details in labels explain why a visual is colored a certain way**. Gain greater insight through the use of color legend than ever before!
